This is an Odin Project Assignment, intended to increase my familiarity with HTML and CSS

I decided to challenge myself a bit and experiment with the hover behavior while doing this project. Mostly though, this project helped me get used to some basic CSS (positioning elements, centering objects horizontally, paying attention to display types, etc.)

I was also able to get more familiar with Chrome Devtools, especially since I used it quite a bit to dissect the Google homepage.

This challenge originated from The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
